- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @muskaan712
- > I am a Master's student in Computer Science at UniversitÃ¤t Bonn, specializing in machine learning and self-supervised learning. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant in the Applied Machine Learning Lab, focusing on human brain image interpretation techniques. I am passionate about advancing AI-driven solutions for medical applications.
Areas of Impact:

- Previously, at ZB Med (Uniklinikum KÃ¶ln), I developed FAIR-compliant ontologies for research software and a recommendation system.
- At EISLAB, LuleÃ¥ University of Technology, I worked on contrastive learning frameworks for diabetic retinopathy detection, achieving state-of-the-art results.
- My research has been published in conferences like ICIP and IJCNN, and I hold a patent for a real-time pothole detection system.
